# PREDICTIVE ANALYISIS-ANZ
## Overview
  This analysis estimates annual salary for each customer from transaction data, explores correlations between salary and customer attributes, and builds predictive models. We derived attributes like total transaction amount, average transaction amount, and transaction count, then visualized correlations, finding notable relationships, particularly with age. A linear regression model and a decision-tree model were built and evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R^2) scores. The regression model showed moderate accuracy, while the decision-tree model performed slightly better. These models could help ANZ segment customers into income brackets, although further refinement and validation are recommended for reliable segmentation.
## Business Problem
  ANZ Bank aims to improve its customer segmentation strategy to offer more personalized financial products and services. The lack of detailed income data for many customers limits the bank's ability to effectively target high-value clients with premium services, optimize credit risk assessment, and enhance marketing strategies. The objective is to develop a predictive model to estimate annual customer income based on transaction data and other available attributes. This model will enable ANZ to segment customers into income brackets, allowing for more tailored product offerings, improved customer service, and optimized marketing campaigns. Ultimately, the goal is to enhance customer satisfaction and retention, improve marketing efficiency, and drive revenue growth by leveraging accurate income estimates for better-targeted financial solutions.
## Dataset
  The Dataset that was given to us is based on a synthesised transaction dataset containing 3 months’ worth of transactions for 100 hypothetical customers. It contains purchases, recurring transactions, and salary transactions. The dataset is designed to simulate realistic transaction behaviours that are observed in ANZ’s real transaction data, so many of the insights we will gather will be genuine. The dataset contains 100 unique accounts. 12043 transactions and 23 features.

## Conclusion
  Based on the features selected and the models, it can be concluded that the Linear Regresion model performed better than the Decision Tree model as it's mse is lower and it's R2 value is more acceptable. The test case for Linear regression model predicted a more acceptable value as well. However, both models' performace are arbitrary and the features may be biased. I personally think that better features can be selected and a more suitable model can be chosen.
